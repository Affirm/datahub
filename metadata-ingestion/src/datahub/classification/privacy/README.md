# Affirm Privacy API
### Detect PII entities in both structured and unstructured data

This repo is being maintained by @jiarui.xu and @yitao.wang in our spare time. The main purpose is to support basic needs of PII tagging as quickly as possible and we have plans to improve this API. If anyone is interested in rule-based and ML-based PII tagging, please reach out!

News
- [1/12/2022] We are going to apply this API in log messages and public app reviews for 2022 hackathon!
  - Log Scanner: in addition to PII entities, we plan to support more entities like MAC addresses, cookies, and other risky items in log messages. 
  - Public App Review Scanner: I found that many customers treat app review as a way to communicate sensitive account issues with Affirm. Not only they left their full names, but also they share their phone number and addresses. With privacy API, we can scan all the app store reviews for PIIs.
